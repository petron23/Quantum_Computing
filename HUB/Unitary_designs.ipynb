    "Unitary designs are used when there is a need for random sampling or randomizations. More precisely, the Haar measure provides a way to sample uniformly from the group of unitary matrices, but generating truly random unitaries with respect to the Haar measure can be computationally expensive. Unitary designs offer an efficient way to approximate this randomness. A unitary design is a collection of unitary matrices that, when averaged together, behaves like an integral over the Haar measure.\n",
    "The 2-desings specifically are used for operation benchmarking on qubits. If an operation is perfectly act on a qubit state as $\\Lambda (|0\\rangle \\langle0|)$ it could be expressed as $V|0\\rangle \\langle0|V^{\\dagger}$. And the fidelity measures their overlapping, i.e. $F = \\langle 0|V^{\\dagger} \\Lambda(|0\\rangle \\langle0|) V |0\\rangle $ "
